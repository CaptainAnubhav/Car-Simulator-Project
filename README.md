# Car-Simulator-Project
In this project , I have used an Arduino Micro as a controller. The code in main.ino does the same. In the car, a rotary potentiometer for the steering wheel and two linear potentiometers-one for brake and another for accelerator were used. The code in value_checking.ino is used to check the values of the steering wheel, accelerator and brakes. Once we have tested the code, we have do some changes in the settings of the control panel. After we connect the Arduino-Micro to our computer, we have to go to Control Panel -> Hardware and Sound -> View devices and printers -> Devices -> More devices and printer settings -> Arduino Micro. Then we need to check whether the steering wheel,brakes and accelerators paramters are working properly by testing them using the car and finally save changes. Same changes have to made in the game in this case, I had used F1.
